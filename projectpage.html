We took a sample of 20% of our intended mailing lists, and sent two versions of the e-mail, one version to each half of the sample. Both e-mails contained identical subject lines.</p></div>

              <p>Version A will be more successful. It is concise, and offers up just enough details to give readers a sense of the event’s experience without resulting in fatigue. In Version B, the list of information might become overwhelming. The details about the experiences and the amenities provided at the event may have gotten lost in the long list of local celebrities’ names, whom some of our audience may not even be familiar with.</p>

            <div class="content" id="panel2-6">
              <p>Because both e-mails contained identical subject lines, their open rate was identical. But Version A has received almost twice as many click-throughs as Version B. Thus, we sent Version A to the remaining 80% of recipients.<p>

              <p><strong>Version A</strong><br>
              Sent: 3260<br>
              Opened: 554 (based on 17% open rate)<br>
              Clicked: 44/554 = .079</p>

              <p><strong>Version B (incumbent)</strong><br>
              Sent: 3235<br>
              Opened: 550 (based on 17% open rate)<br>
              Clicked: 32/550 = .058</p>

              <p><strong>Remainder</strong><br>
              Sent: 21183<br>
              Opened: 3601 (based on 17% open rate)<br>
              Clicked: 297/3601 = .082</p>

              <p>Used .082 (Remainder click rate) to calculate the potential click rate for the total email, which would equal the total sends (27678) times the click through rate for your copy (.082) = 385 clicks VS. Their click rate (.058) times total sends (27678) = 272</p>

              <p>The difference between your potential clicks (385) and theirs (272) is 113. 113/272 = 41.5%, assuming their copy is the incumbent in this test.</p>
